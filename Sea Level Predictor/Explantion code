CLEAN THE DATA SET USING interpolate(method='linear')-This fills NaN values by drawing a straight line between the nearest known values — great for sea level data that generally changes gradually.
--pandas (pd): To load and manipulate CSV data.

matplotlib.pyplot (plt): For plotting charts and graphs.

linregress from scipy.stats: To perform linear regression and get the line of best fit.
❓Why:
We need to:

--Load and inspect the data (Pandas),

Visualize it (Matplotlib),

Analyze trends and predict future values (Scipy's linear regression).
plt.figure(...): Creates a new figure with a defined size.

--plt.scatter(...): Plots a scatter plot using:

Year as x-axis,

CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level as y-axis.

❓Why:
The scatter plot shows how sea levels have changed over time. It gives a visual sense of the data’s trend.
--df['Year']: This is the independent variable (X-axis), typically time (years).

df['CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level']: This is the dependent variable (Y-axis), the value you're trying to model — here, the sea level.

📈 linregress() returns a regression model:
This function fits a straight line to the data:
y=slope⋅x+intercept
The result res_all will contain:res_all is a named tuple with these 6 values:

Attribute	Meaning
slope	How much sea level changes per year
intercept	Estimated sea level at year 0
rvalue	Correlation coefficient (how well the line fits the data)
pvalue	p-value for hypothesis test (used to check statistical significance)
stderr	Standard error of the estimate
